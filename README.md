# Miniproject1
1. Project Overview: What were you trying to accomplish?  What was your general approach?
I tried to analyze text in men gold medalists. I calculated average age of men gold medalists’ when they got the medals, the youngest gold medalists’ and the oldest gold medalists’ name and age and gold medalists’ age graph.

2. Implementation: How does your code work? What libraries did you use? How would someone (for instance a NINJA) run your code? What data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) did you use in your program and why?
I bring all texts of ‘List of olympic medalists in figure skating’ in wikipedia and edit the texts which could contain only men’s gold medalists. I made lists of gold madalists’ name and the years of holding Olympic game. I put the medalists name in Wikipedia address so I also could bring the text of each medalists. In the texts, I bring ages of medalists and made a list of medalists’ age. Using this and years of holding Olympic game, I calculated the ages when they got the medals. Based on these information, I could accomplish average age of men gold medalists’ when they got medals, the youngest gold medalists’ and the oldest gold medalists’ name and age, and gold medalists’ age graph.

3. Include some examples of your program's output.
Average age : 24
The youngest men gold medalist : Dick button, 19
The oldest men gold medalist : Gillis Grafstrom, 35

4. Reflection: from a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Was your project appropriately scoped?
I learned how to bring texts from Wikipedia and how to process texts into what I need. Also I used lots of lists, so I could learn about how to process lists.
